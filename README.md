# Tidyverse 
This library is a one stop shop for data science and data analysis. The purpose of tidyverse is to provide key data transformation functions in a single package.
There are eight core Tidyverse packages namely ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats. All of these packages are loaded automatically at once with the install.
